## Get started

* Run `yarn`
* To run flow use `yarn run check`
* To generate flow types from graphql schema, run `yarn run relay:schema`
* See the example in `src` folder
  * You can compare the file with/without flow
  * Everything with `.done.js` is a flow file, otherwise it is a plain javascript file
